        // pay owner to book hotel room

        // it's better to use call function OVER transfer:

         * if it was sent or not and (bytes memory data) tells us any data that 
         * came back. And then the reuqire statement makes sure, only if the
         * payment was sent, then can the user actually occupy the room ->
         * the event gets emitted.
